# Welcome/Before you start

Now you have started your post-grad studies. Congratulations on your achievement so far and welcome to the academic world for the next three or more years! 

A friendly reminder that this means a lot of responsibility and hard work. Shame! But, there are also bright sides of your decision. You will learn many useful specialised knowledge and life skills to live a better life (possibly)!

A second reminder is to check out the most important difference between a research-based post-grad programme from the school and undergrad education programmes from Prof Matt Might [here](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/). Most importantly, 
> research involves *finding out about things that no-one else knew either*. It is about advancing the *frontiers* of knowledge.

By the way, he also published several useful guides for post-grad students on topics ranging from productivity, useful resources, and even job hunting. You can find them all from the same website.

Also, read the following articles on some basic advice for your post-grad study:

- [作为研究生，这些你都做到了吗?](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/A-9HTiefweSP1CvJrcSirA)

In the following, I will try to answer some commonly asked questions about your post-grad studies. 

# What are the next steps?
At this point of time, you should have realised that your post-grad study is a research based one. The following is a general overview of what a research project entails:
- Identify a research topic
- Develop a research proposal detailing your research question, hypotheses, work plan, etc.
- Conduct actual research work
- Draw conclusions
- Communicate your findings to others

To clarify further, you will need to go through the following steps to complete you MEng/PhD study in a nutsheel (You may skip steps 1-4 if you come prepared).

**Step 1**. Choose a research field (can be a bit broad at this stage). Refer to [How to choose a topic](./choosetopic.html) for guidance.

**Step 2**. Gather information and conduct a literature to familiarise yourself with the *state-of-the-art* and identify **research gap(s)**. Refer to [Literature review](./literature.html) for guidance. You are required to **take notes of what you have read and report your progress regularly.**

**Step 3**. Choose a research topic based on research gaps identified. This now must be very **specific**. Refer to [How to choose a topic](./choosetopic.html) for guidance.

**Step 4**. Consult more literature relevant to the specific topic you have chosen.

**Step 5**. Write up a **research proposal** detailing your *literature review, research gap identified, proposed research question/topic, research methodology, and work plan*. Here the research topic must be clearly defined in a **'question'** with one or more **'hypotheses'**[^1]. **At this stage, you may opt to write up a review article.**

[^1]: A hypothesis is "a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation." (Oxford Dictionary). A hypothesis is a prediction of consequences. It must be verifiable or falsifiable. It is neither too specific nor to general. It is considered valuable even if proven false. It is NOT moral or ethical questions.

**Step 6**. Follow the work plan developed in your proposal to conduct actual research work. This may include but is not limited to *system modelling, data gathering, experiment design, algorithm selection/design, experiments, simulations, results analysis and interpretation*. Note that you will need to go through a number of the above steps iteratively in most cases.

**Step 7**. Write up a **research article** detailing your findings and submit it for possible publication. Alternatively, you file a **patent registration application** based on your research findings. Refer to [How to communicate your research](./communicate.html) for guidance.

**Step 8**. Expand the research article or patent application you've written into a full-length **dissertation/thesis**. Refer to the school's requirements on how you should prepare this document.

**Step 9**. Submit your thesis/dissertation for *external examination and oral defence*.

**Step 10**. Pack all references, data, software and so on related to your research in a well-organised folder structure and **submit** this with documentation on how to use the resources therein to your supervisor.

If you managed to complete the above ten steps, well done and congratulations! Your degree will now be awarded.
