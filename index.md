## How to choose your research topic
There are two important things to keep in mind. 

Firstly, check out the research interests of your supervisor if you already have one (**very important**). This is to make sure that you do not work on something your supervisor is unable/unwilling to provide guidance.

Secondly, take a look at the following slides from Marek J. Druzdzel to get an idea about what makes a good topic.
