## Before you start

Now you have started your post-grad studies. Congratulations on you achievement so far and welcome to the academic world for the next three or more years! 

A friendly reminder that this means a lot of responsibility and hard work. Shame! But, there are also bright sides of your decision. You will learn many useful specialised knowledge and life skills to live a better life (possibly)!

A second reminder is to check out the most import difference of a research-based post-grad programme from the school and undergrad education programmes from Prof Matt Might [here](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/). By the way, he also published a number of useful guides for post-grad students on topics ranging from productivity, useful resources for researchers, and even job hunting. You can find them all from the same website.

In short, research involves *finding out about things that no-one else knew either*. It is about advancing the *frontiers* of knowledge.

Also read the following articles on some basic advices for your post-grad study:

## How to choose a research topic
There are --**two**-- important things to keep in mind. 

Firstly, check out the research interests of your supervisor if you already have one (**very important**). This is to make sure that you do not work on something your supervisor is unable/unwilling to provide guidance.

Secondly, take a look at the following slides from Marek J. Druzdzel to get an idea about what makes a good topic: [How to Identify a Good Research Topic? (A personal view)](https://sites.pitt.edu/~peterb/3005-001/L5.pdf).

## How to find information
The source of information can be the internet, academic databases, libraries, etc. In most cases, you are going to use a combination of these sources. There is a quite lengthy book on this matter: [How to Find Information: A Guide for Researchers](https://www.mheducation.co.uk/how-to-find-information-a-guide-for-researchers-9780335226313-emea-group). However, you can read [this guide](https://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/documents/advanced-search-techniques.pdf) on how to search databases effectively.

## How to read and get organised
Recording keeping is vital in the process of your study. Being keeping a good record of articles you retrived at the information gathering stage, your notes on a specific paper, or your study progress. Failing to do so may result in headaches and wasting of time for days or months. To this regards, there are several free tools that could help you out. For bibliographic reference managment, I personally recommend [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop-new/). [This website](https://www.mendeley.com/guides) and [this guide](https://stglibrary.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/how-to-use-mendeley-a-step-by-step-guide.pdf) are useful resources to help you get started with Mendeley. You can also check out others tools like [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/), EndNote (you can get a copy of this proprietary software through the library service I think), etc.
## How to publish

### Guides on academic publishing

### LaTeX related guides
LaTeX is the mostly used typeseting tool for scientific writing. Please familiarise yourself with this. Your thesis/dissertation and articles should be typeseted using LaTeX.

## Useful resources

- You can find many books [here](https://z-lib.org). Please search "the Z-library project " to find the usable domain in your location in case this one does not work.
- Read the book "The Elements of Style" by William Strunk and Chris Hong (2011) over and over to improve your English writing skills. [Here](https://github.com/lzhangup/pg-resources/files/6258685/The.Elements.of.Style.2011.by.William.Strunk.Chris.Hong.pdf)
 is a copy downloaded from the Z-library.
