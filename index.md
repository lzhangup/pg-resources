## Before you start

Now you have started your post-grad studies. Congratulations on you achievement so far and welcome to the academic world for the next three or more years! 

A friendly reminder that this means a lot of responsibility and hard work. Shame! But, there are also bright sides of your decision. You will learn many useful specialised knowledge and life skills to live a better life (possibly)!

A second reminder is to check out the most import difference of a research-based post-grad programme from the school and undergrad education programmes from Prof Matt Might [here](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/). By the way, he also published a number of useful guides for post-grad students on topics ranging from productivity, useful resources for researchers, and even job hunting. You can find them all from the same website.

In short, research involves *finding out about things that no-one else knew either*. It is about advancing the *frontiers* of knowledge.

Also read the following articles on some basic advices for your post-grad study:

- [ÁªôÁ†îÁ©∂ÁîüÁöÑ‰∏Ä‰∫õÂø†Âëä](http://sixf.org/files/others/ModestAdvice.pdf)
- [‰Ωú‰∏∫Á†îÁ©∂ÁîüÔºåËøô‰∫õ‰Ω†ÈÉΩÂÅöÂà∞‰∫ÜÂêó?](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/A-9HTiefweSP1CvJrcSirA)

## How to choose a research topic
There are ***TWO*** important things to keep in mind. 

Firstly, check out the research interests of your supervisor if you already have one (***very important***). This is to make sure that you do not work on something your supervisor is unable/unwilling to provide guidance.

Secondly, take a look at the following slides from Marek J. Druzdzel to get an idea about what makes a good topic: [How to Identify a Good Research Topic? (A personal view)](https://sites.pitt.edu/~peterb/3005-001/L5.pdf).

## How to find information
The source of information can be the internet, academic databases, libraries, etc. In most cases, you are going to use a combination of these sources. There is a quite lengthy book on this matter: [How to Find Information: A Guide for Researchers](https://www.mheducation.co.uk/how-to-find-information-a-guide-for-researchers-9780335226313-emea-group). However, you can read [this guide](https://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/documents/advanced-search-techniques.pdf) on how to search databases effectively.

## How to read and get organised
Recording keeping is vital in the process of your study. Being keeping a good record of articles you retrived at the information gathering stage, your notes on a specific paper, or your study progress. Failing to do so may result in headaches and wasting of time for days or months. 

To this regards, there are several free tools that could help you out. For bibliographic reference managment, I personally recommend [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop-new/). [This website](https://www.mendeley.com/guides) and [this guide](https://stglibrary.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/how-to-use-mendeley-a-step-by-step-guide.pdf) are useful resources to help you get started with Mendeley. 

You can also check out others tools like [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/), EndNote (you can get a copy of this proprietary software through the library service I think), etc.
## How to communicate your research
Communicating with others effectively is part of our survive skills. The same applies to academics (of courseüòÄ). In the academic world, researchers often need to communicate their findings to others and receive feedbacks. This includes attending seminars, workshops and conferences, and publishing articles in journals and magzines.

### Guides on attending meetings
***Preparation*** is the key to attending group seminars, workshops and conferences, as is for anything. Be prepared allows you to focus on the topics that you are interested in, ask questions that concerns you the most, and communicate effectively with others.

[Here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HTYUcEjPggHgrTHJHqsTQw) is an interesting article on attendinig international conferences which also offers some useful advices.

### Guides on academic publishing
Publishing an article requires hard work not only on how to identify a good research question and finding answers to that question, but also on writing up a report, which usually needs to go through iterations of revisions. For the most of you, publishinig an article is a compulsory requirement to confirm your degree. So, do pay special attention to publishing. My advise is to discuss with your supervisor at the beginning of your study (as early as you have identified your research topic).

Again, there are many books on scientific writing and publishing. For example, here are two books that provides all around guidance on this matter:
- [Scientific Writing and Communication Papers, Proposals, and Presentations by Angelika H. Hofmann](https://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Writing-Communication-Proposals-Presentations/dp/0190278544)
- [THE SCIENTIST‚ÄôS GUIDE TO WRITING](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691170220/the-scientists-guide-to-writing)

This short book is more on writing styles, which is also very useful: [The Elements of Style](https://github.com/lzhangup/pg-resources/files/6258685/The.Elements.of.Style.2011.by.William.Strunk.Chris.Hong.pdf). Read this book over and over to improve your English writing skills. 

The ***most important*** things are summarised below:
1. You ***MUST*** discuss the _topic, authorship, and target journal_ of your paper with your supervisor before you start your investigation.
2. You ***MUST*** get _approval_ from your supervisor to submit the paper produced as a result of your post-grad study for publication. You do not need to do this if you are submitting a paper that is NOT on the findings of your current post-grad study. In the latter case, you may NOT include your current supervisor in your author list unless a prior permission is obtained.
3. Whatever findings you are publishing ***MUST*** be _quantifiable, verifiable, replicable, and defensible_. The academic dishonesty and plagiarism will result in serious consequences. 


### LaTeX related guides
LaTeX is the mostly used typeseting tool for scientific writing. Please familiarise yourself with this. Your thesis/dissertation and articles should be typeseted using LaTeX if possible.
