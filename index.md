# Welcome/Before you start

Now you have started your post-grad studies. Congratulations on your achievement so far and welcome to the academic world for the next three or more years! 

A friendly reminder that this means a lot of responsibility and hard work. Shame! But, there are also bright sides of your decision. You will learn many useful specialised knowledge and life skills to live a better life (possibly)!

A second reminder is to check out the most important difference between a research-based post-grad programme from the school and undergrad education programmes from Prof Matt Might [here](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/). Most importantly, 
> research involves *finding out about things that no-one else knew either*. It is about advancing the *frontiers* of knowledge.

By the way, he also published several useful guides for post-grad students on topics ranging from productivity, useful resources, and even job hunting. You can find them all from the same website.

Also, read the following articles on some basic advice for your post-grad study:

- [ÁªôÁ†îÁ©∂ÁîüÁöÑ‰∏Ä‰∫õÂø†Âëä](http://sixf.org/files/others/ModestAdvice.pdf)
- [‰Ωú‰∏∫Á†îÁ©∂ÁîüÔºåËøô‰∫õ‰Ω†ÈÉΩÂÅöÂà∞‰∫ÜÂêó?](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/A-9HTiefweSP1CvJrcSirA)

In the following, I will try to answer some commonly asked questions about your post-grad studies. 

# What are the next steps?
At this point of time, you should have realised that your post-grad study is a research based one. The following is a general overview of what a research project entails:
- Identify a research topic
- Develop a research proposal detailing your research question, hypotheses, work plan, etc.
- Conduct actual research work
- Draw conclusions
- Communicate your findings to others

To clarify further, you will need to go through the following steps to complete you MEng/PhD study (You may skip steps 1-4 if you come prepared) in a nutshell.

**Step 1**. Choose a research field (can be a bit broad at this stage). Refer to [How to choose a topic](./choosetopic.html) for guidance.

**Step 2**. Consult and critically evaluate the literature on the chosen topic to familiarise yourself with the *state-of-the-art* and identify **research gap(s)**. Refer to [How to find information](./findinformation.html) for guidance. You are required to **take notes of what you have read and report your progress regularly.**

**Step 3**. Choose a research topic based on research gaps identified. This now must be very **specific**. Refer to [How to choose a topic](./choosetopic.html) for guidance.

**Step 4**. Consult more literature relevant to the specific topic you have chosen.

**Step 5**. Write up a **research proposal** detailing your *literature review, research gap identified, proposed research question/topic, research methodology, and work plan*. Here the research topic must be clearly defined in a **'question'** with one or more **'hypotheses'**[^1]. **At this stage, you may opt to write up a review article.**

[^1]: A hypothesis is "a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation." (Oxford Dictionary). A hypothesis is a prediction of consequences. It must be verifiable or falsifiable. It is neither too specific nor to general. It is considered valuable even if proven false. It is NOT moral or ethical questions.

**Step 6**. Follow the work plan developed in your proposal to conduct actual research work. This may include but is not limited to *system modelling, data gathering, experiment design, algorithm selection/design, experiments, simulations, results analysis and interpretation*. Note that you will need to go through a number of the above steps iteratively in most cases.

**Step 7**. Write up a **research article** detailing your findings and submit it for possible publication. Alternatively, you file a **patent registration application** based on your research findings. 

**Step 8**. Expand the research article or patent application you've written into a full-length **dissertation/thesis**.

**Step 9**. Submit your thesis/dissertation for *external examination and oral defence*.

**Step 10**. Pack all references, data, software and so on related to your research in a well-organised folder structure and **submit** this with documentation on how to use the resources therein to your supervisor.

If you managed to complete the above ten steps, well done and congratulations! Your degree will now be awarded.


# How to read and get organised
Recording keeping is vital in the process of your study. Being keeping a good record of articles you retrieved at the information gathering stage, your notes on a specific paper, or your study progress. Failing to do so may result in headaches and wasting of time for days or months. 

In this regard, several free tools could help you out. For bibliographic reference management, I recommend [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop-new/). [This website](https://www.mendeley.com/guides) and [this guide](https://stglibrary.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/how-to-use-mendeley-a-step-by-step-guide.pdf) are useful resources to help you get started with Mendeley. 

You can also check out other tools like [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/), EndNote (you can get a copy of this proprietary software through the library service I think), etc.
# How to communicate your research
Communicating with others effectively is part of our survival skills. The same applies to academics (of courseüòÄ). In the academic world, researchers often need to communicate their findings to others and receive feedback. This includes attending seminars, workshops and conferences, publishing articles in journals and magazines and so on.

## Guides on attending meetings
***Preparation*** is the key to attending group seminars, workshops and conferences, as is for anything. Be prepared allows you to focus on the topics that you are interested in, ask questions that concern you the most, and communicate effectively with others.

[Here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HTYUcEjPggHgrTHJHqsTQw) is an interesting article on attending international conferences which also offers some useful advice.

## Guides on academic publishing
Publishing an article requires hard work not only on how to identify a good research question and finding answers to that question but also on writing up a report, which usually needs to go through iterations of revisions. For most of you, publishing an article is a compulsory requirement to confirm your degree. So, do pay special attention to publishing. My advice is to discuss with your supervisor at the beginning of your study (as early as you have identified your research topic).

Again, there are many books on scientific writing and publishing. For example, here are two books that provide all-around guidance on this matter:
- [Scientific Writing and Communication Papers, Proposals, and Presentations by Angelika H. Hofmann](https://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Writing-Communication-Proposals-Presentations/dp/0190278544)
- [The Scientist's Guide to Writing](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691170220/the-scientists-guide-to-writing)

This short book [The Elements of Style](https://github.com/lzhangup/pg-resources/files/6258685/The.Elements.of.Style.2011.by.William.Strunk.Chris.Hong.pdf) is more on writing styles, which is also very useful. Read this book over and over to improve your English writing skills. 

The ***most important*** things are summarised below:
1. You ***MUST*** discuss the _topic, authorship, and target journal_ of your paper with your supervisor before you start your investigation.
2. You ***MUST*** get _approval_ from your supervisor to submit the paper produced as a result of your post-grad study for publication. You do not need to do this if you are submitting a paper that is NOT on the findings of your current post-grad study. In the latter case, you may NOT include your current supervisor in your author list unless prior permission is obtained.
3. Whatever findings you are publishing ***MUST*** be _quantifiable, verifiable, replicable, and defensible_. Academic dishonesty and plagiarism will result in serious consequences. More on academic ethics can be found [here](./Ethics.html).
