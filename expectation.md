You should be prepared for:
- times when you need to scratch your head
- failures at some point of your study
- harsh but usually constructive comments from your peers and supervisor(s)
- sleepless nights when you do not see a hope in finishing your study

But, you should also be aware of the truth that all that you go through during your study will eventually better yourself in a number of different ways. You will 
- get stronger, knowing that all failures and suffers are temporary;
- be able to deal with problems in the field of your study and the beyond; and
- be able to present your work in different ways and to people from different backgrounds.
