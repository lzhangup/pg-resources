# Welcome message

Now you have started your post-grad studies. Congratulations on your achievement so far and welcome to the academic world for the next three or more years! 

A friendly reminder that this means a lot of responsibility and hard work. Shame! But, there are also bright sides of your decision. You will learn many useful specialised knowledge and life skills to live a better life (possibly)!

A second reminder is to check out the most important difference between a research-based post-grad programme and undergrad education programmes from Prof Matt Might [here](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/). Most importantly, 
> research involves *finding out about things that no-one else knew either*. It is about advancing the *frontiers* of knowledge.

By the way, he also published several useful guides for post-grad students on topics ranging from productivity, useful resources, and even job hunting. You can find them all from the same website.

Also, read the following articles on some basic advice for your post-grad study:
