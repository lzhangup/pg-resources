# How to find information
The source of information can be the internet, academic databases, libraries, etc. In most cases, you are going to use a combination of these sources. There is a quite lengthy book on this matter: [How to Find Information: A Guide for Researchers](https://www.mheducation.co.uk/how-to-find-information-a-guide-for-researchers-9780335226313-emea-group). I highly recommend scanning through this book. At least, you should read [this guide](https://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/documents/advanced-search-techniques.pdf) on how to search databases effectively.
