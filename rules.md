# Attendence register
We need to discuss more details about this. 

In general, students are requested to be present in the lab **from 8am to 5:30pm (autumn) or 6:00pm (summer)**. Note that this time is far from what you need to spend on your study. It is a mere indication of your active enrollment at HUST.

# Leaves
The following leaves are allowed.
- Official absence: for conducting study related works off-campus approved by the supervisor.
- Family responsibility leave: for supporting family members in case of losing a loved one.
- Maternity leave: for taking care of the newborn or recovering from delivery.
- Public holidays: for holidays mandated for PR China by the central government.
- Causal leave: for flexible leaves with a valid excuse.
- Sick leave: for seeing doctors and recovering from illness.
- Vacation leave: for clearing your mind during the summer and winter recess periods.

A student must apply for leave officially by writing to his/her supervisor or a dedicated deputy at least one day before the actual leave except for sick leave. One can apply for sick leave on the same day the leave is taken.
# Safety and housekeeping
**Every** student must observe general safety **rules** and take **all** the necessary safety **precautions** in **all** spaces that they are present. 

Students are requested to empty the dustbin **daily** and keep their workstations and/or labs neat and tidy.
# Progress reporting
Students are requested to report to their supervisors **at least once every two weeks**. This report must include a **written document** explaining what the student has achieved so far the work plans for the coming weeks.
